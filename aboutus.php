<p><b>KPL history highlights</b></p>
<p><b>Incorporation 2003</b></p>
<p>The Kenyan Premier League Limited (KPL) is a private company limited by shares. The company was incorporated on October 31, 2003 under Chapter 486 of the Companies Act of the Laws of Kenya.</p>
<p><b>Kenyan Champions League 2003</b></p>
<p>KPL launched and successfully managed the Kenyan Champions League which became one of the most highly competitive and fairplay leagues in Kenyan football history. It was also the best managed with no matches failing to kickoff, no abandoned matches, no incidents of hooliganism, no referee boycotts, no two-match weekends for any club, no serious injuries to any players, no appeals against the referees or results of any matches and no disciplinary action needed against any club officials or players. Also, no team dominated the other teams as the goal difference was two goals or less for all but two matches. The 2003-04 champions were Utalii FC with Tusker FC as the runner-up.</p>
<p><b>First Transparency Cup 2003</b></p>
<p>In November/December 2003 KPL launched the world’s first Transparency Cup with the theme of “Kicking corruption out of football”. The Cup champions were Utalii FC with Gor Mahia FC as the runners-up. The awards for the top clubs, players and referees were the highest for any Cup competition in the 40-year history of Kenyan football.</p>
<p><b>Second Transparency Cup 2004</b></p>
<p>In March/July 2004 KPL successfully organized the second Transparency Cup. The Cup champions were Kenya Commercial Bank FC with Thika United FC as the runner-up.</p>
<p><b>KPL Football Role of Honour 2004</b></p>
<p>KPL created the first Football Roll of Honour to recognize those who selflessly dedicated themselves to improving Kenyan football and named the following first eleven members who have free lifetime entry to all KPL matches: Mohamed Abbas, Ahmed Breik, Peter Dawo, Kadir Farah, Joe Kadenge, Joe Masiga, Josephat Murila, John Nyawanga, Bob Ogolla, Nahashon Oluoch and Allan Thigo.</p>
<p><b>Kenyan Premier League 2005/06</b></p>
<p>With the agreement of the then KFF, CAF and FIFA, KPL took over the ownership and management of the Premier League which was again highly competitive. Over two-thirds of the matches played were vic-tories and 90% of the matches were only 1 or 2 goal victories or draws. The 2005/06 Premier League champions were</p>
<p><b>New KPL office, staff and outreach 2005</b></p>
<p>In 2005 KPL established a new headquarters and office in Riadha House in central Nairobi and appointed a Managing Director and assistant. KPL also had an office co-located with the FKL at the FIFA GOAL Project headquarters at Kasarani Stadium.</p>
<p><b>Stopping hooliganism 2006</b></p>
<p>After several serious incidents in February 2006, KPL adopted a new ‘zero tolerance’ policy against hooliganism and attacks on referees. In over 400 KPL matches since then, there have been only three attacks on referees which were all firmly dealt with under the KPL policy. The last time a referee was assaulted was in July 2007.</p>
<p><b>KPL support to national teams 2003-07</b></p>
<p>During 2003-07 the KPL clubs provided the majority of national team players and voluntarily released their players for far longer periods than required in the FIFA rules.</p>
<p><b>Cairo Agreements 2006</b></p>
<p>The KPL would likely not have survived without the insistence and persistence of FIFA on protecting the principles and integrity of our sport. The watershed event for saving and improving Kenyan football was the meeting convened by FIFA in Cairo, Eqypt in January 2006. The meetings in Cairo involved the Presidents and senior officials of FIFA and CAF; the Minister, Assistant Minister and senior officials of the Kenyan Ministry of Sports; the Chairman and two senior officials of FKL; and three KPL club representatives.</p>
